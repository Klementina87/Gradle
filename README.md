# *Contacts App*

# *Project Topic/Objective*:
My project idea is creating a database for gym contacts based on age groups. Gym members are stored in a collection and, their information can be modified, saved and/or deleted from the system based on the selected age group. The goal is to easily access gym memberships and provide better customer service. 
 
# *Technical section*:
The main class to run the program is DisplayDataApp.java. This simple JavaFX project was created in IntelliJ using Gradle to simplify the javafx modules. The project contains four classes, where one of them is enum class to categorize age groups.There is an option to view/list all members based on the age group. The methods save, update and delete are in DisplayDataApp.java file. 

I am planning to continue working on the project and finish the add and search methods.
